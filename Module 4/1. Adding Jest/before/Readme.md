### Module 4

In this module were going to explore how we can create integration tests.
We are mainly focused on testing the authentication and authorization of our api endpoints.

There are 2 demos in this module.

1. Adding Jest (and SuperTest)
2. Testing Authenticaton

In the first demo we will add our test frameworks and write a simple test against our OAuth2 Token endpoint.  That's the endpoint that returns our dummy token!

As part of this we've made some changes to our docker compose to allow us to run the tests within Docker.

In our second demo, we will write a test against one of our endpoint to check the authentication and authorisation.
