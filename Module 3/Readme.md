### Securing a REST API

In this module we're focusing on security and how you protect the endpoints within a REST API.

There are 3 demo's in this course.

1. Implementing Authentication
In this demo, we start by looking at a simple example of Basic Authentication, this is not something we typically use but it's interesting to see it.  We will do this in a new Node application.

We then look at how we implement OAuth2 using Json Web Tokens in our Course Service API.

2. Authorization Techniques
In this demo we look at Role Based Access Control and Attribute Based Access Control

3. Secure Communications
In this demo we look at other tools we we have available to us for securing our API including:
* SSL/TLS
* CORS
* HTTP Headers
