### Module 2

In this module we just need to be certain that you can run the API locally on your machine and that you can run the existing proof of concept API that we're working with in this course.

You have several options for running the code.

1. Install the MongoDB database locally.
2. Run the API inside Docker using the included docker file and docker compose files.

You can find more info on this by looking at the Running_Locally.md file in ths folder.

If you want to know more about installing MongoDB the check out the Installing_MongoDB.md file for instructions.

You do not need to be able to run the code but you may wish to explore some of the code and practice some of the concepts.
